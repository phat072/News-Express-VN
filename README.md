# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
    // other rules...
    parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: 'latest',
        sourceType: 'module',
        project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
    },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
# VnExpress

The code provided is a part of a React application and consists of three components: `Header`, `Header_Category`, and `HeadLines`.

1. `Header`: This component is responsible for rendering the header of the application. It includes the current date and time, social media icons, and the application's logo. It also includes a child component `Header_Category`.

2. `Header_Category`: This component is a part of the header and is responsible for rendering the navigation menu of the application. It includes a list of categories that are displayed in the header. The categories are stored in a state variable and are mapped to create a list of links. The component also includes a search bar that is toggled visible and invisible based on the state of a boolean state variable.

3. `HeadLines`: This component is responsible for rendering a list of headlines. The headlines are stored in a state variable and are mapped to create a list of links. Each headline is displayed in a marquee (a scrolling display of text). The component also includes a loading spinner that is displayed while the headlines are being fetched.

Each of these components is exported as a default export, which means they can be imported with any name in other files. They are all functional components and make use of React hooks for managing state and side effects. The `moment` library is used in the `Header` component for formatting the current date and time. The `react-icons` library is used for displaying various icons in the components. The `react-spinners-components` and `react-fast-marquee` libraries are used in the `HeadLines` component for displaying the loading spinner and the scrolling text, respectively.
